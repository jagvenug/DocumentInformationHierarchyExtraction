When two trends share the same row in the Graphic Trends window, with one trend label shown on the left and one trend label shown on the right, and both trends have the same data values, the waveform areas will overlap each other. The overlapping waveform colors will not blend together. As the trend values change, the waveform shape will also change, allowing its individual waveform color to become visible. If there is missing trend data, a gap appears. If the time cursor is positioned within that gap, parameter numerics still display. Depending upon the position of the time cursor within the gap, the displayed parameter numerics are either the last known parameter values before the gap or the first known parameter values after the gap. 2048001-001E CARESCAPE Central Station 125 Data review tools 6. 7.
